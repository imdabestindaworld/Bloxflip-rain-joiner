# How Does It Work?
1. Connect to Websocket1.
2. Websocket1 will notify when there is a rain event through the `on_message` function.
3. When there a rain, get an hcaptchatoken using an hcaptcha solver.
4. Connect to Websocket2, which is the main websocket for joining the rain.
5. Send needed messages in Websocket2 to participate in the rain.
6. Repeat the process, But start at number 2.

# How Can I Obtain It?
1. send 6$ through ltc1qwq6q87ytq8kvu8hs64njqtycv0vkvfrrhp2vmd, i could prove that the autojoiner is mine, exist, functionate in many way 
2. join my old server at https://discord.gg/2Dd894Pb then dm me. or, can contact me nonamebetoo#6403.
3. ill send u the rain joiner source atfer that

# Why Pay?
I need funds to get an hcaptchasolver for my future bots. even thought I used my rain joiner in the before and earned an average of 3.6k Robux every 5 days with 5 accounts, I ended up gambling it in the hopes of earning more. as a result from that, now i don't any available hcaptcha usages, preventing me from using my rain joiner again.

# Advantages
1. Low CPU usage.
2. Supports multiple accounts.

My rain joiner only use `requests` and `websocket` libraries as main library, without requiring any browser related libraries
Ill help u implent any more feature that u could think. ill send 10 hour video of using my rain joiner if someone send me soon
